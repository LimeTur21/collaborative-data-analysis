### **Initialize Libraries**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### **Retrieve Data**
```{r}
# I think we should write this such that someone could fill a folder with csv's and it would run through them sequentially, however we should probably jsut make it source the data from github so Tony can try it out without downloading a bunch of our data
d <- read_csv("")
```

### **Feature Extraction**
```{r}
# Resting Em

# Input Resistance

# We can add more but I figured lets start with these 2 even though I think it'ss be really easy to compute these
```

### **Visualization**
```{r}
# Save plots and also visualize them here for visual confirmation that the code is working

```

### **Additional Stuff?**
```{r}
